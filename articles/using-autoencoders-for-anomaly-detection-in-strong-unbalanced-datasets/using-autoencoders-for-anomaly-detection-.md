# Using Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Strong Unbalanced Datasets

**Anomaly detection** is a critical task in various domains such as fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and medical diagnosis. One of the main challenges in anomaly detection is dealing with **strong unbalanced datasets**, where the number of anomalous examples is significantly smaller than the number of normal examples.
**Autoencoders** can be used to solve the anomaly detection problem in strong unbalanced datasets.

## Autoencoders

Autoencoders are **neural networks** that are trained to reconstruct the input data. They consist of two parts: an encoder that compresses the input data into a low-dimensional representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the low-dimensional representation.

In anomaly detection, the autoencoder is **trained on normal data** and then used to **detect anomalies** by comparing the reconstruction error of new data to a threshold. The reconstruction error is the difference between the input data and the data reconstructed by the autoencoder.

## Anomaly Detection approach

The idea behind this approach is that the autoencoder should be **able to reconstruct normal data well**, but will have a higher reconstruction error for anomalous data. Therefore, any data that has a reconstruction error above a certain threshold is considered an anomaly.

One of the **main advantages** of using autoencoders for anomaly detection in strong unbalanced datasets is that it **does not require** labeled anomalous data, which can be difficult to obtain in some applications. Moreover, the anomaly detection approach **avoid to learn the anomalous pattern**, so this model will not be dependent to the anomaly pattern, that can change in time. In this way, the detection of the anomalies will be **more stable and independent** to any evolution in the anomalous pattern.

Additionally, autoencoders can be used in combination with oversampling and cost-sensitive learning techniques to balance the dataset and improve the performance of the anomaly detection model.

However, one of the main challenges of using autoencoders for anomaly detection in strong unbalanced datasets is choosing an appropriate **threshold** for the reconstruction error, which can be sensitive to the specific dataset and application. Changing the threshold, it is possible to adapt the performance of the detection, such that a restrict threshold led to have **more precision** while larger threshold **more recall**, so it will depends on the task.

## Conclusion

Autoencoders can be a useful approach for solving the anomaly detection problem in strong unbalanced datasets. They do not require labeled anomalous data and can be used in combination with other techniques to balance the dataset and improve performance. However, choosing an appropriate threshold for the reconstruction error and avoiding high false positive rates are important considerations.
