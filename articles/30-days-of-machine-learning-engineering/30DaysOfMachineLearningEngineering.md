# Thirty Days of Machine Learning Engineering

## Day 0 - What is this challenge about?

After completing the #66DaysOfDataChallenge, I decided to tackle a new challenge, namely the **#30DaysOfMachineLearningEngineering** challenge! 

During the last two years I learned a lot about theoretical concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and several other related disciplines. However, I recognize that I still need to learn and to work on some of the “**best practices**” in the field. 

After some research, I found the great book “**Machine Learning Engineering**” by [Andriy Burkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/), and after I’ve read the foreword by [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/), I was convinced that it was the right one. 

Therefore, for the following **30 days**, I will share daily bites from the book and I would love to open some debates on the relative topics! 

I will convey all the daily posts on a **GitHub repository** and this **blog**!

P.S. I do truly believe on the values of this challenge, and great examples can be given by [Boris Giba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisgiba/) and [Tinham Tamang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinam-tamang/), just to name a few. 

Disclaimer: The book is distributed on the “read first, buy later” principle. Therefore you can  freely read the book too and then decide to buy it!
