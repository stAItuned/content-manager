## Introduction

When explaining the decision-making process of AI models, **eXplainable AI (XAI)** methods like variable importance, partial dependence plots (PDP), and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots are widely used. However, applying these tools to non-linear, black-box models trained on **correlated features** can lead to **misleading insights**.

This article explores why traditional XAI methods fall short in such cases, highlights the problem of correlation breakdown, and presents **conditional data permutations** as an effective solution.

## The Background: XAI and Correlated Features

### The Role of XAI Methods

XAI methods aim to:
- Quantify feature importance for predictive models.
- Visualize relationships between input variables and outputs.

Common tools like variable importance and PDPs rely on **univariate permutations**, where one feature is varied across the entire dataset to evaluate its influence on the model.

### The Problem of Correlation

In datasets with **correlated features** (e.g., socio-economic variables or genetic traits), univariate permutations disrupt the **correlation structure**. This leads to:
1. **Overstated Importance**: Correlated features appear more influential than they truly are.
2. **Neglect of Uncorrelated Factors**: Important but uncorrelated features are undervalued.

*Example*: Imagine two correlated features, `X1` (income) and `X2` (education level). If `X1` is permuted without considering its relationship to `X2`, the resulting analysis misrepresents their combined effect.

## The Solution: Conditional Data Permutations

Conditional data permutations address this issue by maintaining the **correlation structure** of features during analysis. Here’s how it works:

1. **Conditional Permutations**: Instead of shuffling a feature across the entire dataset, it is permuted **conditionally based on related features**.
   
2. **Maintaining Correlation**: This ensures that the relationships between variables remain intact, leading to unbiased and accurate measures of feature importance.

3. **Implementation with Trees**: For tree-based models like Random Forests:
   - Permutations occur within the **final nodes** of the tree.
   - This approach respects the feature splits learned during training.

## Practical Applications of Conditional Permutations

### Variable Importance
Traditional variable importance scores overstate the role of correlated features. Conditional permutations provide **unbiased measures**, ensuring fair evaluation of all features.

### Partial Dependence and ICE Plots
Conditional methods for PDPs and ICE plots prevent extrapolation errors by limiting the evaluation to the observed feature space. This improves interpretability and reliability.

## Example Scenario: Using Conditional Permutations in Random Forests

### Scenario
You’re analyzing a medical dataset to determine which factors influence the risk of a disease. Two features, `X1` (blood pressure) and `X2` (heart rate), are highly correlated.

### Traditional Approach
Using univariate permutations, the model overemphasizes `X1` and underrepresents `X2`. This skews the interpretation, leading to potentially harmful medical recommendations.

### Conditional Permutations Approach
1. **Within Node Permutations**: Both `X1` and `X2` are permuted only within their respective leaf nodes.
2. **Preserved Correlation**: The dependency between blood pressure and heart rate is maintained.
3. **Accurate Results**: The variable importance scores reflect the true influence of both features.

### Outcome
This approach ensures that the model insights are **reliable and actionable**, preventing misinterpretation that could harm patient care.

## Conclusion

XAI methods like variable importance, PDPs, and ICE plots are invaluable for interpreting machine learning models. However, when applied to datasets with correlated features, traditional approaches can mislead. **Conditional data permutations** offer a robust solution, preserving feature relationships and providing unbiased insights.

By adopting conditional techniques, practitioners can achieve **more accurate and reliable interpretations**, unlocking the full potential of XAI.
